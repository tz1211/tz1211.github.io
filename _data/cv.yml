    Projects:
      - name: Are Personas All You Need? Stress-Testing Persona Vectors as Alignment Tools 
        summary: Evaluation of persona vectors as alignment tools in LLMs.
        highlights:
          - Evaluated the reliability of persona vectors as low-dimensional alignment tools for modeling behavioral traits. 
          - Analyzed geometric properties of persona vectors to quantify cross-trait interference during finetuning. 
          - Identified key robustness failures such that minor natural language variations produce persona vectors with cosine similarity as low as 0.6.
